            Hello Dev World! I am Osaro, a self-learning Front-End Developer
            fluent in HTML, CSS, JS (sub-intermediate) as well as some libraries
            & frameworks. For about 10 months, I have been on this road of
            discovery and I must say it's been an interesting ride.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having studied on platforms such as freeCodeCamp, codeCademy,
            w3schools & sololearn, I can confidently claim to be a Developer
            inasmuch as I know that I still have a lot to learn. My projects are
            a testament of my growth over time and I am glad that I have been
            making stuff right from the start. There is so much ground to cover
            and I have come to realize that being a Developer is a life-long
            learning process. If you are just starting to learn coding, I advise
            you try to create something, get your hands dirty. There are a
            mammoth of resources out there, get busy studying while writing
            codes. Try to pass-on the knowledge to someone below your fluency
            level to help them and yourself.
          </p>
          <p>My first post, I hope to write more...</p>
          <p>
            Happy Coding! I am @osaroDEV on twitter, github, codepen & dev.to
