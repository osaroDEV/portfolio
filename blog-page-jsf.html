          <h2>PREFACE</h2>
          <p>
            It all began roughly 12 months ago. I had just completed several
            Google courses on digital marketing which I embarked on right after
            resigning from my 9 to 5 job. Web development was the next frontier
            for me. Hence, I researched languages and resources I could use to
            first take a peek/get a glimpse as to what programming entails.
          </p>
          <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
          <p>
            Sololearn happened to be the first I tried-out. I was fascinated by
            the curriculum and the community therein. HTML was great and
            exciting because I was not only reading but I made good use of the
            'playground'. The sololearn code playground became my first-ever
            editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got stuck and 'migrated' to w3schools especially to get another
            perspective on Javascript. TBH, Javascript seems like a never-ending
            road.
          </p>
          <p>
            CodeCademy has been of great help. Here, I discovered React as well
            as many tools that aid developers. React, for me, encompasses
            everything frontend.
          </p>
          <h2>ACHIEVEMENTS: WHAT I KNOW</h2>
          <p>
            Overtime, I have earned a number of certifications and completed
            many mini-projects. I have come of age in web development circles
            and I feel using #codenewbie is now a 'no-no'. I shall be
            'launching' my portfolio site very soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            My only regret is that I should have been blogging about my progress
            from the very start. My consolation is that I have been tweeting
            here thanks to #100DaysofCode..
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a list of tools I can confidently use: git, vscode, cli/git
            bash, browser dev tools. The languages, frameworks & libraries I can
            employ on my projects are: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JS, jQuery, NextJS,
            ReactJS & nodeJS. However, I keep making discoveries in JS, ReactJS,
            NextJS & nodeJS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am sure I have left-out a whole lot as this was rushed. Kindly
            share if you like and follow me on twitter and checkout some of my
            mini-projects on github.
